# 1. IPv4 Revision
---
### Terminology
- IP packets = Datagrams
- End stations = Host

### Basic IP service (Best Effort): Datagram Delivery
Connectionless, Unacked, Unreliable, Unordered.

### IP Address Reperesentation:
265.265.265.265  
\<network-ID> \<Host-ID> (specified by netmask)

### Address Aggregation
A big problem is the size of the routing/forwarding tables so to reduce the size; suppose G is the border router which has 4 internal networks. G summarizes the 4 networks and only announces 1; outside routers only need 1 address table instead of 4. A packet from outside destined for an internal network inside G only needs to go to G and G will know how to forward it internally.

### Simplified Packet Processing
**If** packet is not destined to router & packet forwarding not enabled then packet is dropped.

**Else** 
-  Check if packet is destined to a directly reachable station (on same ethernet) and delivery packet if yes; then stop processing. Otherwise, consult forwarding table for next hop and outgoing interface. 
-  Decrement TTL; drop packet if 0
-  recompute packet HDR checksum (see if corrupted)
-  Hand packet over to outgoing interface

>  **Forwarding Table** maintained by a routing daemon a process executing a routing protocol. 
>> Linux Commants for forwarding table:  
>> - netstat
>> - ip route

## Forwarding Table
Each entry contains:  
- Dest IP prefix  
- Info about next hop (IP addy of next hop must be directly reachable or interface toward it point to point links)  
- Flags; whether next hope is router or directly attached net
- specification of outgoing interface
