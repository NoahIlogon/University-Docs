# Routing

## How ARP is used in Datagram Forwarding
! Complete this

## ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
Accompanies IP by allowing routers or dest hosts to inform sender about unusual situations:
- No route to dest
- Dest host exists but not reachable
- Frag required but DF Set

> - ICMP messages are encapsulated in IP datagrams, (Courtesy protocol) and doesn't add any  
> additional mechanisms like error control.
> - Host must not rely on ICMP messages

! Look at Message Format

ICMP has type/code combinations
type | code | meaning
0    |  0   | echo Reply
3    |  0   | Dest net unreachable
...etc
