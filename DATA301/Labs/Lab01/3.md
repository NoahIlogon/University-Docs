```python
def closest_to_0_5(aA):

    diffs = abs(aA - 0.5)

    min_indices = diffs.argmin(axis=1)

    aA_t = aA.transpose()

    closest_values = da.choose(min_indices, aA_t)
    
    return closest_values
```

Here's what each line does:

diffs = abs(aA - 0.5) - This calculates the absolute difference between each element and 0.5. The result is a Dask array with the same shape as the input, where each value represents how far that element is from 0.5.
min_indices = diffs.argmin(axis=1) - For each row, this finds the index (column position) where the difference is smallest. This gives us a 1D array with one index per row, indicating which column contains the value closest to 0.5.
aA_t = aA.transpose() - This transposes the original array, swapping rows and columns. If the original array was shape (m, n), the transposed array is shape (n, m).
closest_values = da.choose(min_indices, aA_t) - The choose function is key here. It takes:

An array of indices (min_indices)
A sequence of choices (the transposed array aA_t)

When the array is transposed, the rows become columns. The choose function selects from the first dimension of aA_t using the indices in min_indices. Since the first dimension of aA_t contains what were originally the columns of aA, we're effectively picking the right column value for each row.

This approach is efficient because:

It uses Dask's parallelized operations throughout
It avoids loops and list comprehensions
It keeps operations lazy until computation is triggered

The result is a 1D Dask array containing the value closest to 0.5 from each row of the original array.
