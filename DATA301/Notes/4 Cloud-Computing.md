### Association Rules
{i1, i2, ..., ik} -> j 
"If basket contains all of i1, ..., ik then it is likely to contain j"

conf(i -> j–) = support(i union j)/ support(i)

## Cloud Computing
Network based computing that takes place over the internet.  

**Virtualization:** Implement of VM's; abstraction of a physical host machine. Middle layer for security.

**The Jaccard Similarity** of two sets is the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union: 
$$sim(C1, C2) = | C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|$$
**The  Jaccard Distance:** 
$$d(C1, C2) = |C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|$$
Intersection divided by the union

**Distance Between 2 point stance
$$D(p1, p2) = (p1 . p2) / (|p2| * |p1|)$$
